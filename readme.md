# 🎮 Very Cool Pong

A personal Pong-inspired arcade game project with (hopefully) chaotic ball physics and item-based twists, built using Python and Pygame.


## 📌 About the Project

**Very Cool Pong** is my take on a modern and quirky reinterpretation of the classic Pong game. It started as a personal side project during university to practice object-oriented programming, dive into Python game development, experiment with game physics, and explore Pygame’s capabilities.

The game implements classic mechanics like speed scaling for the ball, and expands on the original concept by introducing item pickups — such as the implemented ball duplication item — to create a more chaotic and dynamic experience.


## 🧠 Why I Built It

- To improve my Python OOP skills through a hands-on project  
- To understand real-time game loop architecture and collision systems  
- To explore Pygame as a lightweight game development tool  
- To create a fun, chaotic version of Pong to play with friends  


## 🕹️ How to Play

- **Player 1**: `W` / `S` to move up/down  
- **Player 2**: `↑` / `↓` to move up/down  
- Press `SPACE` to start the game  
- Press `R` to reset scores and restart  
- Bounce the ball to avoid letting it get past your paddle  
- Hit items to duplicate the ball and increase the madness

| **Math / Random** | Ball physics and randomized item spawn |


## 🚀 How to Run the Game

### Option 1: Run the Executable (Recommended for Windows)

1. Run `veryCoolPong.exe`
2. Enjoy!

### Option 2: Run from Source (Cross-platform)

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org)  
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
    python ./code/main.py
4. Enjoy!
